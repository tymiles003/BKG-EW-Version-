Manual for rtcm3torinex

The program rtcm3torinex is an real-time converter from NTRIP streamed RTCM3
data into the RINEX format.

RTCM3 defines a number of message types. Among them are the following:

Message
Type  Contains information about
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1001  GPS L1 code and phase
1002  GPS L1 code and phase and ambiguities and carrier to noise ratio
1003  GPS L1 and L1 code and phase
1004  GPS L1 and L2 code and phase and ambiguities and carrier to noise ratio
1005  Station coordinates XZY for antenna reference point
1006  Station coordinates XYZ for antenna reference point and antenna height
1007  Antenna descriptor and ID
1008  Antenna serial number
1009  GLONASS L1 code and phase
1010  GLONASS L1 code and phase and ambiguities and carrier to noise ratio
1011  GLONASS L1 and L1 code and phase
1012  GLONASS L1 and L2 code and phase and ambiguities and carrier to noise ratio
1013  Modified julian date, leep second, configured message types and intervall
1014-1017 Network RTK (MAK) messages
1019  GPS Ephemeris
1020  GLONASS Ephemeris
1045-1046 Galileo Ephemeris
1071-1077 GPS-MSM data
1081-1087 GLONASS-MSM data
1091-1097 Galileo-MSM data
1101-1107 SBAS-MSM data
1111-1117 QZSS-MSM data
1121-1127 BeiDou-MSM data
4088-4095 Proprietary messages (under development)

Note that this version of rtcm3torinex only handles RTCM3 message types 1001,
1002, 1003, 1004, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1019, 1020, 1045, 1046,
1071-1077, 1081-1087, 1091-1097, 1101-1107, 1111-1117 and 1121-1127.

The generated RINEX is somewhat limited due to the streaming character of the
conversion:

 - Header records can only represent data, which is known after receiving the
   very first epoch. Data rate, position, number of observations and any such
   additional fields cannot be provided.
 - The number of observables cannot change during the program runtime. Only
   the observables, which exist in the first epoch are output. If there
   are new observables later on, these are ignored.
   The Option --changeobs removes that limitation, but not many tools can use
   the resulting files which include header change records.
 - Only known message types are interpreted. Send me new RTCM3 data files and
   data support can be improved. See contact address at the end of this document.
 - If the ambiguity field in the RTCM3 data is not set, the output will be no
   valid RINEX. All values will be stored modulo 299792.458. A COMMENT line
   will tell you, when this happens. It would be necessary to approximately
   calculate the range to fix the ambiguity (needing ephemeris/alamanac and
   easy positioning algorithm).

Usage: ./rtcm3torinex -s server -u user ...
 -d --data             the requested data set
 -f --headerfile       file for RINEX header information
 -s --server           the server name or address
 -p --password         the login password
 -r --port             the server port number (default 2101)
 -t --timeout          timeout in seconds (default 60)
 -u --user             the user name
 -E --gpsephemeris     output file for GPS ephemeris data
 -G --glonassephemeris output file for GLONASS ephemeris data
 -3 --rinex3           output RINEX type 3 data
 -S --proxyhost        proxy name or address
 -R --proxyport        proxy port, optional (default 2101)
 -n --nmea             NMEA string for sending to server
 -O --changeobs        Add observation type change header lines
 -M --mode             mode for data request
     Valid modes are:
     1, h, http     NTRIP Version 2.0 Caster in TCP/IP mode
     2, r, rtsp     NTRIP Version 2.0 Caster in RTSP/RTP mode
     3, n, ntrip1   NTRIP Version 1.0 Caster
     4, a, auto     automatic detection (default)

The fields --user and --password are used to specify the access data for the
NTRIP server. The arguments --server and --port are used to specify the NTRIP
server itself (defaults to "www.euref-ip.net" port 2101). The Argument --data
must be used to specify the RTCM3 input data stream. If it is not given, you
will be shown the source table of the selected NTRIP caster.

Alternatively a single text of the form
"ntrip:data[/user[:password]][@[server][:port][@proxyhost[:proxyport]]][;nmea]"
can be used. Everything in brackets is optional.

Additionally the argument --headerfile can be used to provide additional header
information. The file must contain normal RINEX observation file header lines.
The given lines overwrite the automatical generated lines. Overwriting the
lines "# / TYPES OF OBSERV" and "TIME OF FIRST OBS" usually is a bad idea and
you will get warned if you do so. The line "END OF HEADER" is ignored.
Unknown lines or COMMENT lines will be appended before the "END OF HEADER".

NOTE: The tool does not check the input lines for validity. So be sure to
use correct RINEX specifiers as well as correct alignment.

To stop RINEX output send the program a killing signal. Following signal
sources are supported:

signal    number  usual source of the signal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIGINT       2    pressing CTRL+C in the shell running the tool
SIGQUIT      3    pressing CTRL-\ or sending QUIT signal
SIGTERM     15    called kill <num> with the process number of rtcm3torinex
SIGPIPE     13    the output or input of rtcm3torinex has been closed

The programm will be terminated after the current epoch has been finished.
You will not get corrupted RINEX files.

When compiling the program with older gcc versions running the `make'
command, you may receive an informative error message saying

rtcm3torinex.c: In function `signalhandler_alarm':
rtcm3torinex.c:1240: warning: `noreturn' function does return

This is most likely a compiler problem which only concerns the optimization
and is thus not critical. New compilers will not show this problem.
